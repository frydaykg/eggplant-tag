# eggplant-tag
Service to track emails similar to bananatag.com. Idea of project is to have service for email tracking without need to give access to my email to third-party company.

By default it designed to host on Google App Engine.

To track your email just add in content the following:
<ul>
  <li>in HTML mode: &lt;img src='link_to_tag'/></li>
  
  <li>in editor mode: add image of tag by link(!), not as content</li>
</ul>
